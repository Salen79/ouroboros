# company/ — Product Portfolio

CEO (Ouroboros) builds products here. Each product gets its own subdirectory.

## Structure

```
company/
├── product-1/        # VendorLens (first product)
│   ├── backend/
│   ├── frontend/
│   └── README.md
├── product-2/        # Future product (self-funded)
└── shared/           # Shared libraries (if any)
```

## Rules

1. Every product must pass the mission filter (BIBLE.md)
2. Every product must be approved by Shareholder at Product Gate
3. Tests are mandatory before deploy
4. No secrets in code — env vars only

## Financial model

- First product: $1000 starter capital
- Subsequent products: 70% of company revenue
- 30% of all revenue → Shareholder (non-negotiable)
